# OrderUp

OrderUp uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM to serve up and devour whatever you'd like (or send it back if you don't).

## Usage

You can add any items you'd like from the input box at the bottom of the page. You can then deliver the items to the corresponding 'table' by simply clicking on them and then devour it or send it back if something is wrong. 

It's deployed on Heroku [so just click here to get started](https://pure-wave-41572.herokuapp.com/)!
